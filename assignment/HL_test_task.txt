Create simple table using real data from our API.

1) Using Individual statistics endpoint get data about all players - see https://logiq.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/individual-statistics/individual-statistics
- generate API token using credentials below - see https://logiq.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/authentication/create-authentication-token
{
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "john",
    "client_secret": "doe"
}

- you'll need to generate competition uuid - see the documentation using links above, find competition endpoint, use it and pick one of the listed competitions by your choice
- use body:
{
  "gameState": "5:5",
  "timeOnIce": 600,
  "metrics": [
    "xg60",
    "c60",
    "sogc_pct"
  ]
}

2) Create simple data table using stats in response.
3) To control the table, include:
- 3 check-boxes for the 3 metrics mentioned above controlling their presence in the data
	- unchecking means not including the metric in the API call
	- all 3 boxes unchecked lead to warning message "Please choose at least one metric!"
- button to load data
- possibility to sort the data by all of the columns clicking on the header
4) Transfor the "toi" stat into time format mmmm:ss

Design of the table doesn't matter, just make sure it doesn't look messy.
